/* poxbridge.h — cross-process channel between a poxicle particle *producer*
 * (a Wayland client that runs its own sim, e.g. Chiguiro) and the poxicle-kwin
 * compositor effect, which draws the producer's instances on the producer's
 * window. The effect can't observe a client's internal triggers (terminal bell,
 * process spawn/exit, overscroll), so the client sims and streams ready-to-draw
 * instances; the effect only positions + draws them.
 *
 * Transport: one POSIX shared region (a memfd handed to the effect over D-Bus)
 * per producer toplevel. The producer writes each frame's PoxInstance[] into the
 * body and bumps a seqlock; the effect polls the seqlock every compositor frame
 * and copies the latest complete frame. No per-frame D-Bus — only Register /
 * Unregister (once each) and Wake (only on an idle->active edge, to un-park the
 * effect's repaint loop).
 *
 * This header is plain C and self-contained on purpose: the producer side can
 * copy it verbatim (Chiguiro's KgxParticleInstance is byte-identical to poxicle's
 * PoxInstance, so it maps the same body layout without depending on poxicle.h).

 *   - odd                               => producer is mid-write, skip this poll
 *   - even & advanced                   => a new complete frame is in the body
 * The producer bumps seq to odd, writes count + body, then bumps to even (with
